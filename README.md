# Sia for Android  [![Awesome Kotlin Badge](https://kotlin.link/awesome-kotlin.svg)](https://github.com/KotlinBy/awesome-kotlin) [![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-love.svg)](http://forthebadge.com) [![Google Play Link](https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_60.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vandyke.sia)

This app serves as an Android client for the decentralized cloud storage platform [Sia](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia). Sia has the potential to disrupt the cloud storage industry, and a successful mobile app for Sia will greatly help in making this a reality. This app aims to be that.

This app can:
* Run a Sia node on your device
* Interact with all wallet functionalities of the running node - create, send, receive, etc.
* Interact with the renter module, including uploading to and downloading from the Sia network
* Coming later: Function without entire blockchain, once Sia implements this feature

This app is developed independently by me. It is not an official Nebulous Labs product.

This app is currently only under very light development, but contributions to it through this repository (pull requests, issue reporting, feature ideas, etc.) are still welcomed, encouraged, and appreciated. I am happy to help with implementations and answer any questions you might have.
